### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### First time actually using github, might fix this later
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making a videogame (I have been procrastinating for so long)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java through my school's AP CSA class
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with how to get started on making a videogame
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my classes (I will complain about how difficult they are)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: dm me on discord username: warpthetoast
- âš¡ Fun fact: I hate math (I don't know why I keep on doing it though)
